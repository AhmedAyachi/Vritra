[**Vritra**](https://vritra.github.io) is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

-  **Standalone:** Has no dependencies.
-  **VanillaJS-Based:** No need to master any additional technologies but your Javascript, HTML and CSS.
-  **Component-Based**: Construct self-contained autonomous components and then combine them to create complex user interfaces.

Vritra is specifically designed for hybrid-web apps but as it's a standalone JavaScript library, you can feel free to use it anywhere you want.
